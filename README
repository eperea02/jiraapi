This is a cli for the Jira API to easily create issues.

To run this script copy the `run_ijira` bash script to your EC directory.

Then export these variables:

```
    export JIRA_USRNAME=<jira_username>
    export JIRA_PASSWORD=<jira_password>
```

Then running: `./run_ijira --help should show the correct output`
